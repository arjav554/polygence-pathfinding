**Comparative Analysis of Pathfinding Algorithms in High-Entropy Environments
**This repository contains the source code and experimental data for a research project evaluating the performance of five distinct pathfinding algorithms. The study investigates the structural relationship between algorithmic performance (scalability, optimality) and environmental complexity (obstacle density, topology).
